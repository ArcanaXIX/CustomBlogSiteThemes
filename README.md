# CustomBlogSiteThemes
Aren't you tired of boring bland corporate web design.
Don't you just wanna go apeshit.
(use with TamperMonkey to make your dashboard on The Blogging Website whatever colors you want. Put a background image if you want. YOLO)

Step 1: get TamperMonkey here - https://www.tampermonkey.net/
Step 2: do you just want to change the color palette of your blogging website dashboard? Go to the custompalette file.
        do you want to also have a custom background image for your dashboard, and make it Early Web chaos? Go to the custompalette_bg_img file.
Step 3: click the "copy raw file" icon (looks like 2 rectangles, between the "raw" and the download icons). This copies the scripts.
Step 4: open the TamperMonkey extension you installed on your browser in step 1. Select "create a new script."
Step 5: paste the file you coped in step 3 into the new script.
Step 6: save the script. Refresh Tumblr. your dash should now have a palette that I think is great and you probably think sucks.
Step 7: play around with values until you have the aesthetic experience you like.

You can replace the RGB values of any of the variables you want. You can upload any background image you want to Postimages and link it.
The world is your oyster. All I have given you is the framework. Go forth.

(Also if any of you figure out a more elegant way to have a background image than the janky shit I did please let me know.)
